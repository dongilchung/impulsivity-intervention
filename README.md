# Simulating future rewards: exploring the impacts of implicit context association and arithmetic booster in delay discounting

The shared codes and data are related to the preprint (https://doi.org/10.1101/2020.03.03.974709).

1.  Data of main experiment are stored in the file ‘0_Data/accumData_Ex1.mat’, and data of forrlow-up experiment are stored in the file ‘0_Data/accumData_Ex2.mat’. 
2.	A script titled ‘_data_analysis_ex_1.m’ is used for plotting Fig2 and Fig3. And a script titled ‘_data_analysis_ex_2.m’ is used for plotting Fig4 and Fig5. 
3.	Folder ‘2_Bootstrapping’ consists  two matlab script which show bottstrapping result of two studies.
4.	In subfolder ‘Function’ consists  one library and three matlab script which estimate stastical result of bootstrapping. Library of 'distributionPlot' is used for plotting violin plot (reference: https://kr.mathworks.com/matlabcentral/fileexchange/23661-violin-plots-for-plotting-multiple-distributions-distributionplot-m). 'ccbootsrappingttest.m' and 'ccbootsrappingttest2.m' are used to run ttest with bootstrapping. 'ccbootsrappingregression.m' is used to run regression analysis with bootstrapping.
